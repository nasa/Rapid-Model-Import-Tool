Introduction
=======================

Rapid Model Importer better known as RMIT is a custom software developed and published by Kennedy Space Center's XR Lab. 
The goal of RMIT is to make a workflow in which a user can take a complex model such as a CAD assembly or large sized artistic model and reduce and modify it to be fit in an envirornment such as Virtual Reality. 
Currenly RMIT utlizes the open source software Blender, and is primarly built in the Python programming language.

Use Cases
------------------------------
If you are a 3D Model Artist and are working with high polygon and complex models you may want to experience you creation in different viewing forms. 
RMIT will create a workflow in which you can make your models fit for those different viewing forms, especially AR/VR.

If you are an Engineering who does a lot of CAD you may want to view your model from a different perspective or show it to clients easier.
RMIT will work to reduce your complex CAD models while still retaining high functionality.

If you are a Human Factors Engineer you want to test human factors on certain projects with as little effort as possible. 
RMIT will get your CAD or high fidelity models prepared for better human factors interfaces.

If you are a XR developer RMIT is completely open source for you to customize it for your specific modeling needs.


Layout
------------------------------
RMIT is layed out into two main sections. The first is the launch widnow, where you are presented with import/export and other options.
If you run RMIT as normal you will be presented with a Blender window in which you can run more functions to edit your model. 
Both of these can be seen below and the complete workflow can be found in the features workflow section
