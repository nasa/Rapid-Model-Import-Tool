Ben Fairlamb - Summer 2019 NIF Intern Abstract
===============================================

The Rapid Model Import Tool (RMIT) is being designed to accept 3D CAD models imported from other tools, reduce their file sizes, and export them to a format that is compatible with Unity (a popular game engine). The converted files are then made available to engineering personnel to view and evaluate on Windows 10 laptops with Virtual Reality head mounted displays at their worksites. The current focus of the project is to expand the capabilities of the tool from .dae (COLLADA/OpenCOLLADA) formats to include a variety of others including .obj (Wavefront), .fbx, .stl, and .stp (STEP). My primary portion of the project consisted of documenting and researching the file formats and their compatibility with Blender 2.8, the latest release of Blender.

All of the file formats with the exception of .stl have at least some caveats. .stl works fine and is supported by Blender completely. Blender supports the OpenCOLLADA version of .dae, not COLLADA as exported by Autodesk, Catia, and various other CAD software. This was already known and a previous intern was able to write a parser that converted COLLADA files to OpenCOLLADA format to make it compatible with a previous version of Blender. I found this OpenCOLLADA converter is also supported by Blender 2.8. Blender 2.8 is partially able to import .obj files. All geometry is imported, however if the file contained multiple objects, they all come in together as one mesh object instead of separately. Blender 2.8 only supports .fbx versions 7100 or later. Most software available exports an .fbx version compatible except for 3ds Max and .fbx has not been a problem.

STEP files are not supported by Blender at all and any effort to implement support would be particularly difficult. STEP files store geometry as boundaries, not as individual vertices or polygons. Because Blender 2.8 does not support STEP, an importer would have to be written to generate the geometry from these boundaries. This becomes even more complex due to the specifications of the format. The STEP format specifications are fairly loose, and as such different tools have different STEP exports. In order for RMIT to support STEP files, it would need an importer written that not only generates the geometry, but also is able of parsing files by the tool that exported them.

Upon completion of this research I have been assisting further development of RMIT through the addition of features. One such feature Iâ€™ve added is the zeroing of imported models. This takes the imported models, moves them to the origin, and sets all of the transforms of the object to zero (rotation, and position), and normalizes the scale to 1, making the exports easier to import into Unity and other 3D environments.
