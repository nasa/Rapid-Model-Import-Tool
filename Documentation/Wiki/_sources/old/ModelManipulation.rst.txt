Blender Model Manipulation Functions
=====================================

This page contains a guide to all functions written by Ben Fairlamb over summer 2019

apply_modifiers()
-----------------

 - Found in Utils\\applyModifiers.py

This function applies all object modifiers. This function is separated from export as the native export's apply modifiers option is slow.

cleanUp(percent)
----------------

- Found in RMIT_BlenderDriver.py

ARGS:
Float **percent**

 - Percent of scene proportions to use for clean up in decimal form

This function removes small objects relative to the size of the entire scene. The function calculates the axis alligned bounding box for the scene then uses the percent to create a smaller axis alligned bounding box that has sides percent length of the scene's. Any object that can fit in the box is then removed.

deParent()
----------

 - Found in Utils\\deParentinator.py
 
This function strips away any parent relations between objects. This flattens the object tree to a single layer. This function also removes any empty objects which have type='EMPTY'.

modelPrep(sepByLoose)
---------------------

 - Found in Utils\\modelPrep.py

ARGS:
Bool **sepByLoose**

 - Separates objects by loose if true

This function does all the preprocessing before cleanup/decimate. It uses Blender's built in functions to:

	- Separate objects by loose parts (loose parts are vertices/edges not connected to other vertices/edges)
	- Center all objects origins to their centers
	- Moves all objects so the group center is at the origin
	- Freezes transformations

This function also centers all objects to the origin.
