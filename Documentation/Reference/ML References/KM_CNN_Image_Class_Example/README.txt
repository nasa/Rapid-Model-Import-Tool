--README for Project 1--

Put test data under a folder "dataset/test".

"current_model.h5" and "weights.h5" in general folder are my "best model" for testing.

Run "Project_1_test.py" to test data set.

"Project_1_train.py" is the script used to train the model.

Logs folder was used with tensorboard to look at graphs.

"train" and "valid" folders have been deleted from the "dataset" folder to reduce size of the submission folder.

Best trained model had a train accuracy of 0.698 and valid accuracy of 0.640, but sample test accuracy was around 0.400.
